# ShieldAuto
[![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/wotomas/ShieldAuto) ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/wotomas/maven/ShieldAuto/images/download.svg)

We were tried of fetching proguard config files for every libraries that were needed to be included in release APK. By using [ShieldAuto](https://github.com/wotomas/ShieldAuto/) developers don't have to worry about checking proguard config file to check if setup is correct for each imported libraries.

[ShieldAuto](https://github.com/wotomas/ShieldAuto/) checks your dependencies extension defined in the build.gradle file to check for matching proguard and generates an simple proguard config file. [ShieldAuto](https://github.com/wotomas/ShieldAuto/) is a Java based Gradle plugin to manage proguard config for release build.
 
This is still a premature version and any helps are welcome. Test cases, refactoring, optimization, bug fixes and adding any libraries are welcome. Current State diagram is as following:

# How to use?
```gradle
// modify project level build.gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        ... 
        maven {
            url  "https://dl.bintray.com/wotomas/maven"
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath 'info.kimjihyok:ShieldAuto:0.0.4'
    }
}
```

```gradle
// add ShieldAuto plugin below application plugin 'com.android.application' plugin
apply plugin: 'info.kimjihyok.ShieldAuto'

android {
    ...  
    buildTypes {
        release {
            // apply sheidlAuto.auto() to proguardFiles configuration
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro', shieldAuto.auto()
        }
    }
```

# Note
Currently ShieldAuto is able to check for libraries imported only through compile configuration. (Which is deprecated and should be replaced with implementation, but direct access is not allowed right now.) I would love for additional help with this issue.
